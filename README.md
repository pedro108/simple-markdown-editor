## Features

- Enter your markdown code on the left-hand side, and click the *RENDER* button to render it on the right-hand side;
- Toggle live render checkbox to allow it to render the markdown as you type;
- It caches the last entered markdown code to allow editing it later, keeping it after closing tabs.

## Dependencies

- This solution was created using `React`;
- It uses `react-testing-library` for creating tests;
- It uses `styled-components` library to add styling as custom React components;
- It uses `markdown-it` as its markdown rendering engine.

## Scripts

- `yarn start` to run the development server on http://localhost:3000;
- `yarn test` to run automated tests.
